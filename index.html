        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Ana Valdivia and I am on a journey to become a web developer. Growing up I always wanted to be an Architect, I just loved the idea of being able to design something and then seei it built. When I graduated High School I began the route which I thought would allow me to fulfill my dream. </p>
        <br>
        <p>As with all dreams, things did not go as planned. I attended El Camino College, where I engulfed myself in Math and Physics. I had not realized how much I enjoyed Mathematics until that point in my life. I transferred from El Camino College to UCLA, in 2015, as a Mathematics major. Being accepted to UCLA was a dream that I shared with many of my peers. During my education at UCLA, I experienced a personal life altering event. Due to this unfortunate event I was unable to complete my Mathematics degree and instead I had to settle for a degree in Geography; since this was the only thing I could complete before my financial aid ran out. </p>
        <br>
        <p>When I graduated I was very frustrated with myself, I felt like a failure. I spent a couple of years working every single day. I knew I wanted to change something in my life but I did not know where to start. In my current occupation, I received the opportunity to work directly with a web developer in creating a customized tool for my department. Through that experience I became interested in coding. My co-worker became a close friend and encouraged me to try web developing. Before enrolling in the UCLA Extension Bootcamp, I tried teaching myself the coding basics, but struggled without the support the program offers. So here I am, ready to learn as much as I can in order to change my life! </p>
