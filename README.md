Week1 HW 

For this HW, nothing is currently responsive. 

The structure of the document is made with html and CSS. There are three linked html files; the about me page, contact, and portfolio page. 

There is a navigation bar at the top of the page that allows a user to go through the three different html files. 

The about me page gives an introduction and has a photo.

The contact page includes three input fields that would allow a user to send me a messgae. The input fields included on the page are; a name field, an email field, and a message field. The message field allows for the user to write a longer message while still keeping it visible. There is also a "submit" button included. 

The portfolio page is a collection of completed projects. Each project is represented by a photo and a title bar across the photo.
